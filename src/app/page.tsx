			<h3 className="text-2xl mt-3 mb-1">About this project</h3>
			<p className="indent-[1rem]">
				After many months, if not years, of complaining about recipe sites and
				day-dreaming about nice-to-have features for a personal recipe
				management tool this project finally came to life.
			</p>
			<p className="indent-[1rem] mt-1">
				Have you ever looked into your fridge, seen 5 - 7 things that have to be
				used soon but you don&apos;t feel like cooking the same veggie-rice pan
				every time to get rid of them? Or you are uninspired for the upcoming
				week, want to eat healthy and would like to have a list of recipes with
				a grocery list to go shop based on what is still in the house?
			</p>
			<p className="indent-[1rem] mt-1">
				This project aims to provide this tooling. Also, it is supposed to be a
				learning project to shift my current skillset towards full-stack.
			</p>
			<p className="indent-[1rem] mt-1">
				My background is mostly in frontend development at the moment, but my
				goal is to be able to build a full application on my own, as well as
				work professionally as a full-stack developer. Whilst I have a deep
				understanding of how the applications I helped build work, and was
				responsible for the architecture and implementation of these projects,
				here I am responsible for every part of the stack.
			</p>
			<h3 className="text-2xl mt-3 mb-1">Current state</h3>
			<p className="indent-[1rem]">
				Right now the focus lies on learning the new tech stack, raw
				functionality first. Things look ugly and responsiveness on mobile is
				not of importance so far. Once things are setup properly, I feel
				comfortable with the new stack and can work fluidly, these things will
				be addressed.
