## Component library

[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)

Reason: It's simply css, is very efficiently tree-shaken and basically is a utility library in a way i wrote utility myself already. It's a perfect fit so far.

Only doubts: when writing my own components, especially the multiselect that is planned, it might not hold up. Due to the css-only approach of daisy this might not be an issue at all though.

## Icon library

[iconfiy](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/)
which set has yet to be decided, but that is done when doing the styling
